# Wi-fi-access-control-using-face-recognition
Source code in Python 3 for a Wi-fi Access Control System, using a Raspberry Pi3B, a nodeMCU ESP8266 Wi-fi module, and the libraries open_CV, face_recognition and requests.
The system is capable of recognizing the pre-saved faces, as well as adding new faces to its data folder.
It is also capable of allowing the access to remote doors via Wi-fi module, according to the permissions configured for each user.
This work is an extension of the face_recognition study available at:
